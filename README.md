## Greetings.

This document is based on my experience. I think this will be fruitful for others so I like to share it with everyone. My suggestion is that if your rating is <= 1100 or >= 1400 in codeforces you can skip it here.

Special thanks to MD. REJWAN KABIR HAMIM([Hamim99](https://codeforces.com/profile/Hamim99)), ASHFAQUR RAHMAN ADIB([adibur6](https://codeforces.com/profile/adibur6)), and HASAN MESBAUL ALI TAHER for their valuable recommendations and reviews.

**\*\*Just a reminder:** There is no shortcut in competitive programming. These strategies are just toimprove the process of thinking that we have gained from our experiences.

Let’s start!

As you are reading this, I hope you know about basic programming languages and online judges. Here I will discuss how to think and how to solve problems. I have also added some problems as examples (the related problems can be solved in other ways too). Note that these problems are not enough to practice. These problems are provided here so that you can relate a problem with the tactics.

## Pre-tips: Knowing Codeforces better

This section is suggested by Ashfaqur Rahman Adib([adibur6](https://codeforces.com/profile/adibur6)). Those who are eager forcompetitive programming need to love this sector and also try to find interesting content in competitive programming. Competitive programming is a long-term process, it will be better if you make it fascinating.

It is also suggested that you keep track of your day-to-day problem-solving.

Let’s see codeforces at a glance:
In Codeforces you can see the list of programmers from all over the world in the [rating](https://codeforces.com/ratings) section.
<a name="br2"></a>Add them to your friend list and follow their hard work and dedication. There is a [catalog](https://codeforces.com/catalog)[ ](https://codeforces.com/catalog)[section](https://codeforces.com/catalog)[ ](https://codeforces.com/catalog)where you can find a lot of resources.

**Now move on to problem-solving strategies in the PDF file.**

## [Beginners Choice PDF](https://github.com/Alamin-Bhuiyan/Journey-To-Be-Specialist/blob/main/Beginners%20Choice.pdf)

Keep patience and take my gratitude for reading this long document. Hope it will help you in some way. Now you shouldpractice more problems that are more than 200 of your current rating. Try to participate in Atcoder contests regularly.

Here I also suggest solving these 100 problems: [Medium](https://kenkoooo.com/atcoder/?fbclid=IwAR2ZMrJ3rbRfc3hQIxBuCRi-6OpOWLfiNKjwQ7BdFcl66d13LQPuFe5dChI#/training/Boot%20camp%20for%20Beginners/2)[ ](https://kenkoooo.com/atcoder/?fbclid=IwAR2ZMrJ3rbRfc3hQIxBuCRi-6OpOWLfiNKjwQ7BdFcl66d13LQPuFe5dChI#/training/Boot%20camp%20for%20Beginners/2)[100

● Participate in virtual contests


● Upsolve after every contest and virtual contest

● Try not to watch solutions

● Take help from editorials and comments
